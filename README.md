Software Engineering Day1 Assignment
#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
ANSWER:  
-	Software Engineering is a process of modelling software.  It is a process of developing solutions to solve problems in the real-world using computer technology which includes principles, methods and tools.
-	The importance of Software Engineering helps in the area of using the solutions to power various aspects of modern life which includes communication, entertainment, commerce, healthcare, lifestyle, etc.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
ANSWER:  The following are 3 key milestones in the evolution software engineering:
-	(1) 1940s Evolution – This is the early computing and programming Languages which includes the creation of the first programmable digital computer and early programming languages like Fortran and COBOL.
-	(2) 1960s Evolution – This is the era when software engineering was described as a Discipline, a study. The term was coined in 1968 at the NATO Software Engineering Conference where the need to practice software development systematically. 
-	(3) 1970s Evolution – Structured Programming and Methodologies.  This period introduced a structured programming concepts and also saw the development of methodologies like Waterfall model for Software Development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
ANSWER:  Below are the Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle:
-	(1) Requirements: This is gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements. 
-	(2) Design: Creating a detailed and well-articulated designs of the software user and client.
-	(3) Implementing: This is the actual phase of building the software according to the design specification.
-	(4) Testing: the developer at this stage must subject the software to various tests to ensure it meets quality standard and the need of the user.
-	(5) Deployment: The software is released to customer or user by installing it in their device and helping them work through it.
-	(6) Maintenance:  This is constantly providing support, updates and enhancement to the software after deployment.
-	(7) Evaluation:  Although this is optional. Review the software development process and outcomes for improving future projects.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
ANSWER:  
-	Waterfall is a methodology that is used to managing software development projects that follows a linear, step-by-step approach where each phase will be completed before moving on to the next stage.  While, Agile method uses short iterations to develop and deliver software incrementally, thereby allowing for regular feedback and adjustments.
-	Water fall is best suited for projects with clear, unchanging requirements and needs for thorough documentation e.g Peach3 accounting software, while Agile can be used to develop in dynamic environments where flexibility, customer feedback, and iterative progress are very important e.g. Google Browsers. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
ANSWER: The roles and responsibilities of the following:
-	Software Developer writes code and implement software solutions.
-	Quality Assurance Engineer, ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
-	Project Manager has the responsibility of overseeing the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects to ensure it meets the set objectives.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
ANSWER:  The importance of the following Software Engineering Tools are:
-	(1) Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code.  Example – Visual Studio, Eclipse, etc.
-	(2) Version Control Systems (VCS) is used for tracking changes to the source code and coordinating work among team members.  Example - Git, Subversion, etc.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
ANSWER:  These are the challenges software engineers faces and the solution:
o	Requirements may change while the software is being developed and this may lead to scope creep and delay in meeting up with the deadline.  The strategies to overcome this is to chose the right methodology that suits the project, like using Agile that enables for constant amendment if need be and carry along the clients and those working on the project.
o	Tight Deadline as the developer will be pressured to deliver the products on or before the deadline and this may result to delivery poor quality software. The best way to avoid this, is to give longer deadlines that could accommodate the period of developing the software.  Do not succumb to tight deadline.
o	Technical Debt is another challenge software engineers face as this may result to impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.  The best way to prevent this is to ensure the cost of developing the software is well calculated and all requirements cost fully captured.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
ANSWER:  The following are the different types of testing:
o	1. Unit Testing – this involves testing individual components software.  The importance of unit testing helps to identify any defects early in the development process.
o	2. Integration – this is testing interactions between components or subsystems.
o	3. System Testing – involves testing the entire software system in totality.  This is important to deliver quality product.
o	4. Acceptance Testing – This is testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.  This is important to ensure customer satisfaction and to meet customer’s objective. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
ANSWER: 
-	 Prompt engineering can be defined as an instruction issued to the robot or AI (Artificial Intelligence) to prepare the specific information.
-	The importance in interacting with AI models depends on its ability to enhance the interaction with AI models, this will lead to a more accurate, useful and relevant outputs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
ANSWER:  
-	Example of a vague prompt is “tell me how to cook rice”.  This is vague because it will not give you the exact information you are searching for.  To improve this, you can say “tell me how to cook jollof rice”.  Here, you are being specific and the AI, by sending this prompt, will give you a clear, specific and concise answer.
-	The improved prompt is more effective as it gives you the exact answer you are searching for.  It enhances the AI model’s ability to understand and respond accurately to the user’s search need.
